provided test class.

 ---
Chapter Sixteen: MidTerm Project
For the mid-term project the student will
complete a game called “Jail Break” that is based
on an old Viking board game. The student will
create the abstract hierarchy of pieces
(AbstractGamePiece, Deputy, Henchman,
Kingpin) and write other logic to complete the
game. The project consists of 6 guided lab steps
